					</header>
					<p>Whether you need someone to work on specific aches and pains or just want a treatment to help you recharge and relax,
						 the wellness massage can be tailored to your personal requirements.



This treatment is built around traditional, Spanish massage techniques, and is a great way to briefly disconnect from the busy everyday.</p>
					<p>i can do Postnatal massage to help unstick all those areas that can become tight
						 and restricted during pregnancy and help return your muscles and posture to their optimum position. Massage also improves circulation and benefits the lymphatic system's functions which helps relieve postnatal swelling.


Once baby is here, your body is tired and needs time to recover. This is difficult during those demanding those first months of caring,
 feeding and everyday life with your new baby.



This postnatal massage will support you physically but also mentally and emotionally. </p>
					<p>I can help with scars ,During this treatment we will assess your scar and the surrounding area including your breathing, to see how the scar is effecting you.



Due to the healing process, your body scar tissue can be tight, thick and become stuck to the wall of the body and even
 sometimes your organs. This can lead to pain, restricted movement and tightness in appearance, manifesting itself
 as a tight band across your stomach.



We work on the scar and the surrounding area to loosen the adhesions, leading to a reduction in tightness and numbness in the area. â€‹.</p>
